"""
Problem Statement: 
Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. 
You should treat numbers of the array as objects, 
hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.

The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, 
white and blue; and since our input array also consists of 
three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
